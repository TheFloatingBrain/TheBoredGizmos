# The Bored Gizmos
These are games that are not exactly games (or bairly meet the definition of such). 
There is no win or failure state, except perhapse in your imagination. The idea is more of a 
toy, or something to "fidget" with, but is not too distracting and does not attempt to engross you.
Its a series of "gizmos" similar to a virtual stress ball or fidget spinner, that you can quickly open 
fidget, then close, if your bored, it might even help you concentrate!
